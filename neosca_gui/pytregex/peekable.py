class peekable:
    """Wrap an iterator to allow lookahead and prepending elements.

    Call :meth:`peek` on the result to get the value that will be returned
    by :func:`next`. This won't advance the iterator:

        >>> p = peekable(['a', 'b'])
        >>> p.peek()
        'a'
        >>> next(p)
        'a'

    Pass :meth:`peek` a default value to return that instead of raising
    ``StopIteration`` when the iterator is exhausted.

        >>> p = peekable([])
        >>> p.peek('hi')
        'hi'

    Negative indexes are supported, but be aware that they will cache the
    remaining items in the source iterator, which may require significant
    storage.

    To check whether a peekable is exhausted, check its truth value:

        >>> p = peekable(['a', 'b'])
        >>> if p:  # peekable has items
        ...     list(p)
        ['a', 'b']
        >>> if not p:  # peekable is exhausted
        ...     list(p)
